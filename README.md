# HTML source in editor
## Rationale
Sometime, it's easier to see the html code of the field instead of the
field rendered. This adds a button allowing to do this change.

## Warning
It may be incompatible with other add-on altering the editor. In
particular with "[Show LaTeX's result in editor/browser](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/882784122)".

## Usage:
Click on "<src>" above a field to see it's source. Click on "field"
afterward to have the normal view back.

## Configuration:
You can decide to remember which fields should show source, and show
sources of the same field in other notes.
